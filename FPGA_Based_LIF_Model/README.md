# 🧠 FPGA LIF Neuron Model – Leaky Integrate-and-Fire

This project implements a **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron** in Verilog HDL, deployed on FPGA.  
I completed this project as part of my **ECE 556 course (Spring 2025 semester)**.  
Developed within the context of **academic VLSI/Neuromorphic research**, it demonstrates real-time biological neuron behavior using hardware-efficient design.  
The project was simulated in **Xilinx Vivado Simulator** and deployed on **Xilinx Cmod S7 (XC7S25-1CSGA225C)** FPGA with real-time spike visualization on LEDs and UART logging.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Implement and validate a hardware prototype of the **LIF neuron model** on FPGA.  

The FPGA LIF Neuron is designed to:

- Model **biological spiking behavior** using a discrete-time LIF equation.  
- Support **step, ramp, and pulse current inputs** to stimulate the neuron.  
- Perform hardware-efficient **fixed-point arithmetic** (instead of floating-point).  
- Provide real-time **LED spike output** and **UART telemetry** for monitoring.  
- Demonstrate scalability toward **neuromorphic computing architectures**.

## 🧮 LIF Neuron Model

- Equation:  
  τm dV(t)/dt = -(V(t) - Vrest) + Rm·I(t)
- Spike condition: 
When V(t) ≥ Vth, neuron fires
- Key variables:  
  - (V(t)): Membrane potential  
  - (I(t)): Input current  
  - (V{th}): Threshold voltage

### Simulation Setup
- Tool: **Xilinx Vivado Simulator**  
- Input types: step, ramp, constant currents  
- Outputs observed: membrane potential (`V`), spike signals  

## 🖥️ Simulation Output

The testbench (`lif_multi_tb.v`) validates the following test cases:

1. Step input current → periodic spike firing  
2. Ramp input current → spike frequency increase  
3. Sub-threshold input → no spikes generated  
4. Pulse input current → burst-like firing  
5. Reset verification after spike

## 🔧 FPGA Implementation
![Cmod_S7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6871913-5378-4050-b530-904d8812f0df)
- **Board**: Xilinx Cmod S7 (XC7S25-1CSGA225C)  
- **Clock**: 100 MHz  
- **Output**: Spike connected to LED, UART stream for debugging  

## 📡 Hardware UART Output

When programmed on FPGA (Cmod S7), the **spike events** are transmitted via UART (115200 baud) and observed using **PuTTY**.  
Each threshold-crossing generates a message, followed by reset confirmation.

### Sample UART Output
SPIKE! - TH1
SPIKE! - TH2
SPIKE! - TH3
SPIKE! - TH4
resets to 0

- **TH1, TH2, TH3, TH4** → Correspond to spike events from multiple neuron thresholds.  
- **resets to 0** → Confirms membrane potential reset after spike.  
- This validates **real-time spiking** and threshold-based behavior on actual FPGA hardware.
