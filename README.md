# 💼 Vignesh_Devaraj_Projects

Welcome to my personal and academic project repository!  
This repo serves as a collection of my projects that I have built during my Master's journey at **George Mason University** and beyond.
A showcase of my academic and personal projects, blending **VLSI, FPGA design, and system-level Verilog development** with hands-on experiments in **neuromorphic computing and digital design**.  
These projects reflect my journey as a Master's student at **George Mason University**, exploring both **theory and hardware prototypes**.

## 📂 Projects

### 🔗 [AHB to APB Bridge Controller](./AHB_to_APB_Bridge_Controller/README.md)  
A Verilog-based **AMBA bus bridge** project developed during my internship at Maven Silicon (VLSI ASIC Design):
- Connects high-speed AHB bus to low-power APB bus
- Supports single and burst transfers
- FSM-based transaction sequencing
- Includes simulation waveforms and synthesis RTL verification  
**Tools Used:** ModelSim | Verilog HDL | RTL Viewer

### 🧠 [FPGA LIF Neuron Model](./FPGA_Based_LIF_Model/README.md) 
A Verilog-based neuromorphic computing project completed as part of my **ECE 556 course (Spring 2025 semester)**:

- Implements a hardware-efficient **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron** on FPGA  
- Demonstrates real-time **spike generation** with LED output and UART logging  
- Uses **fixed-point arithmetic** for efficient FPGA synthesis  
- Validated through **simulation waveforms** and **hardware UART outputs**  
- Tools Used: Vivado Simulator | Verilog HDL | Xilinx Cmod S7 FPGA

### 🔐 [Smart Home Automation](./Smart_Home_Automation/README.md)
A modular Verilog-based system that simulates a smart home environment with:
- Password-controlled security
- Multi-layer alarms (door, window, fire, garage)
- Comfort systems like heater, AC, and smart lighting
- Lockout mechanism and password change support  
**Tools Used:** ModelSim | Verilog HDL
