### 🔗 [AHB to APB Bridge Controller](./AHB_to_APB_Bridge_Controller/README.md)  
A Verilog-based **AMBA bus bridge** project developed during my internship at Maven Silicon (VLSI ASIC Design):
- Connects high-speed AHB bus to low-power APB bus
- Supports single and burst transfers
- FSM-based transaction sequencing
- Includes simulation waveforms and synthesis RTL verification  
**Tools Used:** ModelSim | Verilog HDL | RTL Viewer
